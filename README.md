#### What it doesn't do ?

1. Network configuration.

#### Installation:

1. Head over to Debian website, download netinst Stretch ISO, create bootable USB, install Debian without any desktop environment (https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/).

Tip: (If you don't specify root password you will be able to use sudo out of the box, otherwise you will have to install sudo
and add your user to sudo group).

2. Login with your credentials, and run these commands:
```
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/Soleedus/debian-i3gaps.git
cd debian-i3gaps
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
Then follow instructions, and when script finishes, type:
`sudo reboot`

3. You will need to set GTK theme manually in Chromium.
4. You may now comment out deb-src lines from your /etc/apt/sources.list

#### Custom keybindings: ($mod = windows key)

1. $mod+Return = Termite.
2. $mod+p = Floating pavucontrol for audio settings.
3. Printscreen key for screenshot (saves in ~/Pictures/ folder).
